# Smart-City--Traffic-Density-Based-Crossroads
The project was implemented as part of "Embedded System Design" course. 

In this project, me and my team members designed, developed and implemented a working model of an automated traffic management system to reduce congestion at cross-roads, based on the observed traffic density data in the individual lanes. We also integrated an android application and a RF module to implement over-ride features and manually control traffic during emergencies.

Apart from the code, we used several hardware components like infrared (IR) sensors, Atmega32 micro-controller, RF module, etc.
